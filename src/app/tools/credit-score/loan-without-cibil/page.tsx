          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
            <p>
              An instant loan without a CIBIL score check is a type of personal loan offered by some lenders, primarily FinTech companies and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), to individuals who have no credit history (a "No History" or "NH" CIBIL status) or a very limited one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of relying on your past credit performance, these lenders use alternative data points to assess your creditworthiness. This approach helps first-time borrowers, such as students or young professionals, access credit that they would otherwise be denied by traditional banks.

                    This is different from a loan for someone with a <span className="font-bold">low or poor</span> CIBIL score. Loans without a CIBIL check are specifically for those who are new to credit, not for those who have a history of poor credit management.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-amber-800">Can I get a loan if my CIBIL score is -1 or 0?</h3>
              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Yes. A CIBIL score of -1 (also shown as "No History" or NH) or 0 (less than six months of credit history) is exactly the profile these loans are designed for. It indicates you are new to the credit system, not that you have bad credit.

            <div>

              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Interest rates are generally higher than standard personal loans and can range from 1.5% to 3% per month (18% to 36% per annum), depending on the lender and your individual risk assessment based on alternative data.

              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Some reputable platforms that cater to new-to-credit or salaried individuals include Navi, KreditBee, MoneyTap, and mPokket (for students). Always verify that the lender is RBI-registered before proceeding.

              <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                Yes, successfully repaying an instant loan is an excellent way to build a positive credit history. Once you have 6-12 months of clean repayment history on your CIBIL report, your chances of getting approved for a traditional credit card or a larger loan increase significantly.
